    <h2>Turkish kebab in a pita break</h2>
    <p>This is my version of Turkish kebabs which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online.</p>
    <p>he original sandwiches are made from meat that is pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit. The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and then put into a pita sandwich. </p>
    <ul>
       <li>2 large onions, chopped
    </li>

       <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>

       <li>½ cup olive oil
    </li>

       <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>

       <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

       <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

       <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric
       <li>1 pinch curry powder</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Place the chopped onions in a large ceramic bowl and crush with the bottom of a glass until juice is rendered and onions look translucent. Stir in 2 crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, turmeric, curry powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well; add the sliced beef and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</li>

<li>
    Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, dill, and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Mix well; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>

<li>
    Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>

<li>
    Remove the meat from the marinade mixture, brushing off extra onions. Spread the slices on a baking sheet without overlapping, and salt to taste. Broil about 3 minutes per side or until browned and crispy, turning halfway through cooking.</li>
    <li>Divide the cooked meat between the pita breads, and drizzle with tzatziki sauce to serve.</li>
    </ol>
